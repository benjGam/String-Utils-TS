# String Utils TS

This repository hosts the source code of [String Utils TS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-utils-ts) node module.

## Motivations

The motivation behind this project is that is so sleepy and annoying to do operations on string, so, i decided to put all that concerns into an single module to solve all the problematics encountered in string management, operations, verifications etc.

So, we have now a basic module with few features that helps third-party developpers to handle some annoying cases.

Firstly, this package (c.f 1.x.x versions) was messy, no tests, no clean code and other stuffs. But i saw in this package, a way to improve myself as developer. So the new version will be tested, subject to CI/CD process and i also added a changelog.

This package is a way to help third-party developers but also a way to help myself as developer.

(I'm pretty sure that kind of module already exists and are better than mine, but, in any case, it will be usefull to me)
